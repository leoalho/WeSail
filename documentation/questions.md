- Is it a good idea to have a common types.ts file for both front and backend?
- When for instance adding a new friend to a user is it better to just update the global state or is it better to fetch the user data from the backend
- Is it wise to have a object as a redux slice? or refactor the object into multiple slices
- IS it better to have one big useEffect or several small useEffects.
- how big is too big for a sate to send back and forth the whole time?
